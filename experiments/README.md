# Experiments using the [**mbr**](https://github.com/ZurichNLP/mbr) package

**Reproductions of experiments from the following papers:**

- It's MBR All the Way Down: Modern Generation Techniques Through the Lens of Minimum Bayes Risk (Bertsch et al., 2023)
- Epsilon Sampling Rocks: Investigating Sampling Strategies for Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Machine Translation (Freitag et al., 2023)
- Understanding the Properties of Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding in Neural Machine Translation (Müller & Sennrich, ACL-IJCNLP 2021)

**Other experiments**
- Comparison of [fastChrF](https://github.com/jvamvas/fastChrF) to standard sentence-level ChrF ([Popović, 2015](https://aclanthology.org/W15-3049/)) as a metric for MBR.
